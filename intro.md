## Overview

For CP CLRS can be considered as a good reference book 
for algorithms. Topcoder Tutorials should be read thoroughly and 
the mentioned problems should be solved. Upsolving plays a major 
role for understanding new concepts. Theory for Types and Data Structures,
Algorithms, Programming Languages Fundamentals, Cryptography and Simulations
 and Machine Learning can be read from https://brilliant.org/computer-science/ .
 https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Competitive_Programming has to be followed line 
 by line. Relevant sections from https://github.com/wncc/CodeInQuarantine/tree/master/Week_2_CC 
 can (read must) also be covered.
 
 https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-data-science-531079c38b22 provides a nice 
 introduction to data science. https://towardsdatascience.com/ is a really nice webite 
 to quench your thirst for data science. Once you have explored this field fair enough, 
 you can start with R or Python. But according to me you must first explore which field 
 are you really made for.
